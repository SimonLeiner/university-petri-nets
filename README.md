## Organisation - Project

- Individual projects to implement online process discovery (each individual project corresponds to a single discovery algorithm)
- Web service, CPEE models and subscriptions, Python backend
- Deadline latest end of semester, individually agreed with me
- Submit git respository with getting started + about 15 min of Q&A each
- Technical, e.g., algorithm, Practical, e.g., architecture, Qualitative, e.g., visualization

## Project Assignment

Develop a web application with the following functionality:

- Discover a collaboration process model with your assigned collaboration process discovery technique
- Check conformance of your collaboration process model and the event log with alignment-based fitness and precision as well as entropy-based fitness and precision (Entropia -empr)
- Visualize your discovered model (group collaboration concepts, minimize overlapping collaborations between concepts, ensure left-to-right and top-to-bottom flow) and allow interactive analysis with interaction operations: Zoom in, zoom out, focus on collaboration conceptâ€˜s process only (agent, service, partner), save current visualization to disk (as .svg
  and .pnml)

Your web interface should allow for the following configurations:

- the uploaded event log (27 event logs given)
- the process discovery technique to be applied, i.e., IM, IMf (noise_threshold), and Split miner all parameters / further input of your technique

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SimonLeiner/quantum-scope.git
```

2. Setup the environment:

We recomment using devcontainer for development. You can find the devcontainer configuration in the `.devcontainer` folder. Adjust the configuration to your needs.
