## Organisation - Project

- Individual projects to implement online process discovery (each individual project corresponds to a single discovery algorithm)
- Web service, CPEE models and subscriptions, Python backend
- Deadline latest end of semester, individually agreed with me
- Submit git respository with getting started + about 15 min of Q&A each
- Technical, e.g., algorithm, Practical, e.g., architecture, Qualitative, e.g., visualization

## Project Assignment

Develop a web application with the following functionality:

- Discover a collaboration process model with your assigned collaboration process discovery technique
- Check conformance of your collaboration process model and the event log with alignment-based fitness and precision as well as entropy-based fitness and precision (Entropia -empr)
- Visualize your discovered model (group collaboration concepts, minimize overlapping collaborations between concepts, ensure left-to-right and top-to-bottom flow) and allow interactive analysis with interaction operations: Zoom in, zoom out, focus on collaboration conceptâ€˜s process only (agent, service, partner), save current visualization to disk (as .svg
  and .pnml)

Your web interface should allow for the following configurations:

- the uploaded event log (27 event logs given)
- the process discovery technique to be applied, i.e., IM, IMf (noise_threshold), and Split miner all parameters / further input of your technique

## Getting Started

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SimonLeiner/university-petri-nets.git
```

**Setup the environment:**

- We recomment using devcontainer for development. You can find the devcontainer configuration in the appropriate `.devcontainer` folders. Adjust the configuration to your needs.

CD into the project directory and run the following command:

```
docker compose up -d
```

Ensure that the containers are up and running:

```
docker compose ps
```

If you make changes to the Dockerfile or dependencies, rebuild the containers with:

```
docker compose up --build -d
```
