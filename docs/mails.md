# Mails in Order of Date

## 2024-09-02: Reminder: Final Q&A

Dear participants,

please note that each of you must individually schedule an appointment for your final Q&A regarding your project with me (cf. Slide 3, first session). If you plan to submit in September, you will have to schedule an appointment in the week 23.09.2024-27.09.2024. In exceptional cases, an appointment between 10.09.2024-12.09.2024 is also possible. Your appointment will also be your submission deadline.

Best regards,
Janik-Vasily Benzin
