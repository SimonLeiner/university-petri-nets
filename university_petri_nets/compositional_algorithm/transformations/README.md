# Transformations

A transformation is a tuple ρ = (L, R,cL,cR) where:

1. L is the left part – a subnet to be transformed. 
2. R is the right part – a subnet that replaces L. 
3. cL – constraints imposed on L.
4. cR – constraints imposed on R.

Constraints cL and cR are structural, marking and transition labeling restrictions.
Let N =(P,T,F,m0,mf)be a GWF-net. A transformation ρ = (L, R,cL,cR) is applicable to N if there exists a subnet N ( X L ) corresponding to the left part of ρ .

Verify whether Ni , discovered from LΛi , is a refinement of Ai in IP with i = 1,2,...,k. If so, replace Ai with N i ′ and construct NC = N 1′  N 2′  . . .  N k′ .

Check if directly agentmodel 1' from sublog is a refinement of agentmodel 1 in IP1....IP12. If so, replace agentmodel 1 with agentmodel 1' and construct NC = agentmodel 1'  agentmodel 2'  . . .  agentmodel 12'.

Check if refinement: there must exist a sequential application of transformations from ip-10 to Agent Model 1.
