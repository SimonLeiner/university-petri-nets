# Data

Compositional discovery of architecture-aware and sound process models from event logs of multi-agent systems: experimental data.

## Description

This repository contains the experimental data used for the evaluation of the compositional approach to the discovery of process models from event logs of multi-agent systems, where agents interact according to specific patterns of synchronous and asynchronous interactions.

According to the experiment plan, there is the folder for each interface pattern containing:

The reference model (Petri net encoded in PNML-file)
The event log obtained by simulating the behavior of the reference model (XES-file)
The model discovered directly from the generated event log (Petri net encoded in PNML-file)
The model discovered by composing the agent model w.r.t. the interface pattern (Petri net encoded in PNML-file)
